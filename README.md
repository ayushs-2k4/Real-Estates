# Real-Estates

Developed an automated
Real Estate System in Python using Data Science techniques. Machine learning algorithms, along with libraries like Pandas, matplotlib, SkLearn, and joblib, were utilized to predict house prices based on provided data. The system handles missing data, preprocesses it, and delivers accurate predictions for unseen data, empowering users to make informed decisions in the real estate market.
