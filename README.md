# Real-Estates

I created a Real E-States system in Python using Data Science. I fed the house price data in our model and then also handled the missing data and then created a Machine Learning Model which can predict the house prices of unseen data. I used the Machine Learning libraries like Pandas, matplotlib, SkLearn, joblib.
